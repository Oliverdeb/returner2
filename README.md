# Returner 2
#### Prof Hussein Suleman <hussein@cs.uct.ac.za>
The Returner is a software application used by the Department of Computer Science in order to return
test scripts to students electronically. Tutors scan batches of scripts and the system uses image
processing to recognise the student ID and marks and create PDF files for individual students.
Unfortunately, the recognition does not always work and this causes much frustration for staff, tutors and
students.

## The goal of this project is to create an improved recognition module for the returner, with the following additional features: 
- automatic page orientation detection, using QR code; 
- automatic detection of front pages and nonfront pages, using QR code; 
- robustness for different scanners; 
- robustness for various image sizes and dots-per-inch configurations.
